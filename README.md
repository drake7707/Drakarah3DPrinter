Everything related to my 3D Printer

## Info

The printer started of a Formbot kit and has been upgraded

The build steps for the full kit you can find [here](https://github.com/Zev-se/Formbot-voron-2.4-build-guide)

Additions:

 - Clicky clack door
 - Tough handles
 - BZI (thinking that my Z tension wasn't good but it ended up being TMC Autotune putting the Z motors in stealtchop which can't go fast)
 - Front USB keystone
 - Very cheap USB Camera
 - Handles by 1-0-R
 - Stealtchanger
    - Top hat
    - Extra toolheads
    - CAN distribution
    - Shuttle instead of TAP
    - Mini BFI
    - Docks with crossbar
    - N3MI exhaust panel for multiple CAN cables instead of Galvanic mod

My steps to convert to stealtchanger is [here](steps-to-stealthchanger.md)

## BOM

I try to keep track of a full bill of materials of the entire printer, so anything I add or remove gets updated in the BOM. You can find that [here](BOM.xslx)
